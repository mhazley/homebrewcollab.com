Homebrew Collab is a homebrew club based in Bristol, UK whose aim is to promote and grow the Home Brewing Community in
Bristol and South West England.

We do this by holding collaborative brewing challenges about 4 or 5 times a year in which we typically brew to a theme 
or in collaboration with other breweries, clubs or businesses.

We also have social meetups every few months where we get together to share and taste brews together. 

We have many medal winning brewers in our midst so we also like to see HBC as a place to educate and be educated! Our
keen brewers are always online with answers to questions and more questions to follow!

So, wherever you are on your Home Brewing journey, hit the join page and get to know us!
