Established in 2019, Homebrew Collab is a homebrew club based in Bristol. Our aim is to promote and grow the Home Brewing Community in Bristol and South West England.

We do this by holding regular collaborative brewing challenges 4 or 5 times a year in which we typically brew to a theme 
or in collaboration with other breweries, clubs or businesses. These challenges encourage our brewers to try our new ingedients, beer styles, or techniques, while working together to craft the perfect beer.

We also have social meetups on the last Thursday of everymoth where we get together to share and taste brews together. 

We have many medal winning brewers in our midst so we also like to see HBC as a place to educate and be educated! Our
keen brewers are always online with answers to questions and more questions to follow!

So, wherever you are on your Home Brewing journey, hit the join page and get to know us!
