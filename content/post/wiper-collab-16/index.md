For Collab #16, we visited the Bristol stalwarts [Wiper and True](https://wiperandtrue.com/) at their beautiful
[Old Market Taproom](https://wiperandtrue.com/pages/the-wiper-and-true-taproom-old-market-bristol).

The idea was really simple and fun - we were tasked with designing a beer in the same way that Wiper and True design a
beer and then the end goal was to make that beer and then collectively judge it against the design. 

Wiper steers away from the overly clunky BJCP guidelines and has developed a set of criteria that they design a beer
against. These criteria are much more about how the beer looks, feels and tastes, rather than trying to ram it into a
complex style specification. 

We found it to be a really interesting way to design a beer, so if you want to try it, please find the guide
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p40DwMqa6ZYCFQCtZ-fNzNroEc-IGeMG/view?usp=sharing).

Here's some photos from the night:
