It's that time of year already - Christmas! Well, at least time to announce the our annual challenge. This year, our theme is Christma Movies!

How does it work you ask? Well, two brewers get paired up and randomly assigned a movie title. Your job is to collaborate and brew something inspired by the film. Maybe the title? Maybe a character, or a line of dialog? Perhaps a scene that has inspired you? Or something incredibly tenuous? Doesn't matter, work it out together (and explain the connection).

You have until our October meetup on the 24th to sign up. After that brewers will be paired up and assigned a movie title at random. Then you have until our Christmas party in December to brew and prepare to show off your best work!

For those new to the club, all challenges are free to our Patreons who, for £5 a month support the club and allow us to organise meetups, buy club merch and attend events such as Love & Beer. Everyone else is welcome and encouraged to join us for the Christams challenge but we do ask for a one off contibution of £10 to the club. Or simply, become a Patreon, using the button below.

{{< patreon "Join HBC on Patreon" "https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=89487637" >}}

If you're new and want to take part but don't have a brew kit (we all started somewhere), just make a note in your signup and we'll pair you with an experienced brewer - pick their brains, find out more about their brewing journey and get stuck in to an amazing hobby.

Patreons, sign upon [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/homebrew-collab-23-christmas-reel-ales-tickets-1046365225557)

Of course, everyone else is welcome to join us for our Christmas party to try the brews, meet new people and celebrate our festive get together.
