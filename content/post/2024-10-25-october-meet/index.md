Another great night out at Wiper and True's Taproom, and our special annual announcement of the Christmas challenge pairings. Each year, brewers signup to the challenge, to get paired up and random and their challenge assigned. This year they will need to brew something inspired by their assigned Christmas movie.


| Movie | Brewers |
| :---- | :---- |
| The Santa Clause  | Ian & Dan |
| Jingle All The Way | Pete & Rob |
| Gremlins | Matt & Sam |
| The Grinch | Remy & Ben |
| Die Hard | Kendon & Will |
| Home Alone | Euan & Paul |

We all have until the Christmas meetup on the 18th December back at Wiper to present our finest work.

In addition to the annual challenge admin we opened a few bottles of our own beer we had ready to go, as is tradition, going from low to high ABV:

| Brewer | Name | Style | ABV |

| Will | Orgimmar-Weisse | Hefeweizen | 5.0% |
| Euan | Explorer | Export India Porter | 5.9% |
