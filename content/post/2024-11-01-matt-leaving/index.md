Last night was a great night out tinged with sadness as we send off our much-loved club founder, and man that brought us all together, Matt Hazley. Matt is moving back to Northern Ireland in a few days before travelling the world in 2025. Of course, we only know one way to do a send-off properly and that’s with beer!

Starting at the Swan with Two Necks the group quickly grew, bringing friends together who haven’t seen each other for years. After a few pints had very quickly disappeared we made our way to the club's home at Wiper and True's beautiful taproom, where Evs made a surprise appearance. After drinking through their extensive tap list, last orders were called, and the group separated to make their way home.

As all good nights in Bristol must go, a few stragglers made it to Elmers for just one more, which always guarantees a headache the following morning.

Matt’s passion and dedicated was the driving force in setting up the club in 2019, and attracting high quality, skilled homebrewers from all over Bristol and the South West. His absence at the club meets will be felt immediately, and more importantly his beers will be missed. 

I know for a fact Matt will be making regular trips back to Bristol and we now have plenty of excuses for club trips to Belfast in 2025 and beyond, so this isn’t the end, just an exciting new chapter. On behalf of everyone from the club, we wish Matt and Nic all the best for their new adventures.
