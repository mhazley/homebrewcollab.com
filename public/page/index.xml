      <description>Homebrew Collab is a homebrew club based in Bristol, UK whose aim is to promote and grow the Home Brewing Community in Bristol and South West England.
We do this by holding collaborative brewing challenges about 4 or 5 times a year in which we typically brew to a theme or in collaboration with other breweries, clubs or businesses.
We also have social meetups every few months where we get together to share and taste brews together.</description>
