      <description>For Collab #16, we visited the Bristol stalwarts Wiper and True at their beautiful Old Market Taproom.
The idea was really simple and fun - we were tasked with designing a beer in the same way that Wiper and True design a beer and then the end goal was to make that beer and then collectively judge it against the design.
Wiper steers away from the overly clunky BJCP guidelines and has developed a set of criteria that they design a beer against.</description>

      <description>Our friends at Reading Amateur Brewers invited us to collaborate with themselves and Yakima Chief! What an opportunity!
A squad of HBC brewers hopped on the train to Reading on Thursday 9th March, to meet at Phantom Brewing Co. and get some chat and hop smelling with the legends that are Yakima Chief.
On the night we delved into the details of some experimental HBC Hops that Yakmia will be sending out to us for some experimental brews.</description>

      <description>We are almost 4 years old! Crazy to think we&amp;rsquo;ve grown so much and had so many great collabs over the past few years. We&amp;rsquo;ve become better brewers through it all and 2022 and early 2023 have seen us bag loads of medals at prestigious national comps!
With age comes reflection though and for a while we&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of how we can run HBC a little better and make it more sustainable going forward.</description>
