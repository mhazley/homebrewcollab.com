      <description>Our friends at Reading Amateur Brewers invited us to collaborate with themselves and Yakima Chief! What an opportunity!
A squad of HBC brewers hopped on the train to Reading on Thursday 9th March, to meet at Phantom Brewing Co. and get some chat and hop smelling with the legends that are Yakima Chief.
On the night we delved into the details of some experimental HBC Hops that Yakmia will be sending out to us for some experimental brews.</description>

      <description>We are almost 4 years old! Crazy to think we&amp;rsquo;ve grown so much and had so many great collabs over the past few years. We&amp;rsquo;ve become better brewers through it all and 2022 and early 2023 have seen us bag loads of medals at prestigious national comps!
With age comes reflection though and for a while we&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of how we can run HBC a little better and make it more sustainable going forward.</description>
