      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year already - Christmas! Well, at least time to announce the our annual challenge. This year, our theme is Christma Movies!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does it work you ask? Well, two brewers get paired up and randomly assigned a movie title. Your job is to collaborate and brew something inspired by the film. Maybe the title? Maybe a character, or a line of dialog? Perhaps a scene that has inspired you? Or something incredibly tenuous? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, work it out together (and explain the connection).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Collab #16, we visited the Bristol stalwarts &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiperandtrue.com/&#34;&gt;Wiper and True&lt;/a&gt; at their beautiful&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiperandtrue.com/pages/the-wiper-and-true-taproom-old-market-bristol&#34;&gt;Old Market Taproom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea was really simple and fun - we were tasked with designing a beer in the same way that Wiper and True design a&#xA;beer and then the end goal was to make that beer and then collectively judge it against the design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wiper steers away from the overly clunky BJCP guidelines and has developed a set of criteria that they design a beer&#xA;against. These criteria are much more about how the beer looks, feels and tastes, rather than trying to ram it into a&#xA;complex style specification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our friends at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.readingamateurbrewers.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Reading Amateur Brewers&lt;/a&gt; invited us to collaborate with&#xA;themselves and Yakima Chief! What an opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A squad of HBC brewers hopped on the train to Reading on Thursday 9th March, to meet at&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phantombrew.com/&#34;&gt;Phantom Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt; and get some chat and hop smelling with the legends that are&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yakimachief.com/&#34;&gt;Yakima Chief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the night we delved into the details of some experimental HBC Hops that Yakmia will be sending out to us for some&#xA;experimental brews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
