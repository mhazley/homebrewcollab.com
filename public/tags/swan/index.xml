      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was a great night out tinged with sadness as we send off our much-loved club founder, and man that brought us all together, Matt Hazley. Matt is moving back to Northern Ireland in a few days before travelling the world in 2025. Of course, we only know one way to do a send-off properly and that’s with beer!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting at the Swan with Two Necks the group quickly grew, bringing friends together who haven’t seen each other for years. After a few pints had very quickly disappeared we made our way to the club&amp;rsquo;s home at Wiper and True&amp;rsquo;s beautiful taproom, where Evs made a surprise appearance. After drinking through their extensive tap list, last orders were called, and the group separated to make their way home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
