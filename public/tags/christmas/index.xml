      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year already - Christmas! Well, at least time to announce the our annual challenge. This year, our theme is Christma Movies!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does it work you ask? Well, two brewers get paired up and randomly assigned a movie title. Your job is to collaborate and brew something inspired by the film. Maybe the title? Maybe a character, or a line of dialog? Perhaps a scene that has inspired you? Or something incredibly tenuous? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, work it out together (and explain the connection).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
