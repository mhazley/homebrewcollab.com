      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write up a summary of the weekend. Im assuming by now most people are aware we were lucky enough to be invited to Love &amp;amp; Beer at the Hackney Taproom hosted by the Craft Beer Channel and the Malt Miller. As one of eight clubs representing in the homebrew marque it was a big deal, and one we couldnt turn down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the day we had a total of eight beers to offer the punters, as every homebrewer knows all too well we cant sell them, but we were able to serve them semi-proffesionally through a couple of borried Lindrs. On tap we had:&#xA;-Hazy IPA - brewed by @SamThakkerJones incrredibly popular&lt;/p&gt;</description>
